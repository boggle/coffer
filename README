Coffer 0.0.2
============

Small package for copying between a memory range managed
by C code and Go Buffers.  

Status: Only barely tested right now but it appears to be working :-)

Typical Usage:

import buffer
import unsafe.coffer
import io

var start uintptr
var sz int
var buf io.Buffer

coffer := coffer.NewCoffer(start, sz)

// Read Bytes from C
buf.ReadFrom(coffer)
bytes := buf.Bytes() 

// Write Bytes to C
buf.WriteTo(coffer)

// or
coffer.Write(buf.Bytes())

// Reset to start of memory range
coffer.Seek(0, 0)

// Subsequent Read, Write, or Seek will fail
// Does *NOT* free
coffer.Close()

// Have fun!
