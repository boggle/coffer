Coffer
======

Small package for copying between a memory range managed
by C code and Go Buffers.  

Status: Totally untested right now :-)

Typical Usage:

import buffer
import unsafe.coffer
import io

var startPtr unsafe.Pointer
var endPtr unsafe.Pointer
var buf io.Buffer

coffer := coffer.NewCoffer(startPtr, endPtr)

// Read Bytes from C
buf.ReadFrom(coffer)
bytes := buf.Bytes() 

// Write Bytes to C
buf.WriteTo(coffer)

// or
coffer.Write(buf.Bytes())

// Reset to start of memory range
coffer.Seek(0, 0)

// Subsequent Read, Write, or Seek will fail
// Does *NOT* free
coffer.Close()

// Have fun!
